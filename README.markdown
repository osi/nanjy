nanjy
=====

nanjy is intended to be a "nanny for all your jvm's"

using the attach API, it will monitor all JVM's that it can see.

right now, it just logs the data to the console. future plans include:

* collectd plugin
* local rrdtool
* reconnoiter?

to build, for now, you will need to install your own copy of [jetlang](http://jetlang.com).
